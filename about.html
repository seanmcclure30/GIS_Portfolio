                Hello, my name is Sean McClure, and I am a GIS Specialist with a professional background in geospatial analysis and cartographic design. Since 2022,
                I have been working in the telecommunications industry, managing fiber internet networks for various internet service providers and county-level
                government offices throughout the American Midwest. My role encompasses multiple project stages, including initial design, publishing, data analysis,
                and more. This experience has allowed me to refine my technical skills and deepen my expertise in geospatial information systems. I began my journey 
                in GIS in 2018, studying at both the University of Alabama and the University of Wisconsin, where I completed graduate-level coursework in advanced
                GIS topics. From 2019 to 2022, I worked as a research archaeologist with the University of Alabama, a role where my mapping skills began to mature.
                I gained hands-on experience in recording 3D spatial data across excavation grids and field survey areas, operating remote sensing instruments, and
                analyzing collected datasets. This period provided a solid foundation in geospatial technologies and methodologies.

            </p>
            <p>
               Outside of work, I am passionate about learning new topics and experimenting with new map design techniques. I have developed proficiency in coding
               languages such as SQL, HTML, and Python, which I continuously seek to improve to enhance my understanding of the computer science fundamentals that
               drive modern mapping technologies. My portfolio showcases a selection of projects that reflect my dedication to uncovering meaningful insights from
               geographic data. If you would like to discuss my work or experiences, feel free to contact me via LinkedIn or email. Thank you for your interest, 
               and I hope you have a wonderful day!
